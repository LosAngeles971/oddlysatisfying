            <p>Hi all and welcome to the web application version of the oddly satisfying program!!</p>
            <p>This project focuses on the importance of positive emotions and relaxing moments for stressed developers
                and
                sysadmins. When you are waiting for building your app or for installing a complex software, and you feel
                stress, bad or
                weird mood, then you may use the oddlysatisfying program. The oddlysatisfying program is a completely
                useless script for building nothig! But having oddly satisfying
                log messages till to an always positive ending. The program randomly choose vintage and modern
                operations,
                typing nice logging on your screen and at the end,
                you always receive a positive "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" final message.</p>
            <p>For the best effect, you may have two monitors and use the far one for your boring and stressful
                activities,
                and the close one to run the oddlysatisfying program (maximizing the window!).</p>
            <p>For additional information and if you would contribute to the oddly satysfying program, please see the
                <a href="https://github.com/LosAngeles971/oddlysatisfying" class="underline">project on github</a>.
