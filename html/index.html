            <p>Hi all and welcome to the Web edition of the <i>oddly satisfying program</i>!</p>
            <p>This project focuses on the importance of positive emotions and relaxing moments for stressed developers,
                sysadmins and whoever has to do with computers.
                If you are struggling for building your app or configuring a complex software, or your mega-excel is not
                working anymore, whatever activity you are doing on your computer, if you feel stress or weird mood,
                then you may use the _oddly satisfying_ program. The _oddlysatisfying_ program is a completely useless
                script for building nothig! But having oddly satisfying log messages till to an always positive ending.

                This program randomly choose vintage and modern operations, typing nice logging on your screen and
                eventually an always positive "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" closing message.</p>
            <p>For the best effect, you may have two monitors and use the far one for your boring and stressful
                activities, and the close one to run the _oddly satisfying_ program (maximizing the window!).</p>
